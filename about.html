            Born in 2000, Emeshe Nagy-Zambo is an emerging artist based out of
            Guelph, Ontario.<br /><br/>She has always been fascinated by the
            process of creating art in all its forms and mediums. This drive to
            transcribe her inner emotional landscape into a tangible piece of art
            has led her to develop her current body of work centering around
            themes of trauma and grief. In this process, she externalizes onto
            the figures she paints, various ephemeral experiences tied to the human
            condition.<br/><br/>Having recently begun pursuing art full-time
            in 2023, she has studied at Gritt Gallery Atelier, where she has
            trained under and assisted the artist Eleni Bakopolous. Having
            forgone formal institutional education in favor of direct artistic
            mentorship, she is able to more freely hone her artistic vision
            without the influence of academia dictating her work.
